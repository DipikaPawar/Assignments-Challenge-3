# Assignments-Challenge-3 Requirements

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.

Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
 
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a

# Output:
If the key is not found "None is printed" as the function returne None.
